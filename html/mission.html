<h1 class="header">In the Beginning There was Traffic...</h1>

<div class="saga_pic"></div>

<p class="mission">The twentieth century brought untold progress, but also with it came the blights of new auto-centric development patterns.  Philadelphia, one of America's oldest and greatest cities was always a place oriented toward dense walkable communities.  The nineteenth and early twentieth century brought the trolley system as well, which allowed disparate parts of Philadelphia County to coalesce in a cohesive urban whole.  This led to rising urban blight, which slowly receded as technology became increasingly integrated into the city.  Then, following World War II, as the city was reaching it's peak and prosperity brought the American Dream to more and more people, the city began to empty out, the streets became filled with cars, the landscape covered in parking lots, the air filled with smog, the ears filled with the bellow of horns and engines. In an effort to prevent the outward flood of people from Philadelphia, planners tried to shape more and more of the city in the image of it's suburbs.  They changed zoning, closed trolley lines, and subsidized strip malls, shopping centers, and the automobile. Far from saving the city though, this only expedited it's decline, as the population fell steadily from the 1960s until the 2010 census. During that period of transformation, Philadelphia became the antithesis of human centered design.</p>

<p class="mission">Car Phree Philly has been working hard to build a better city; a human-centric city.  We have been working on projects throughout the metropolitan area to breath new life into one of America's greatest places.  Our work has focused on forging partnerships with neighborhood associations, the Greater Philadelphia Bicycle Coalition, city planners, the city government, various trail organizations, and political activists.  It is only through these relationships and the collective power of their leadership and membership that our mission is possible.  Together we've worked to convert brownfields to greenspace, construct trails, build separated bikeways, initate road diets, and close streets to cars so that people can appreciate and enjoy the beauty of that surrounds us.</p>
